# 🧠 K-Means Clustering Project
# 📋 Project Description

This project demonstrates the implementation of the K-Means Clustering algorithm, an unsupervised machine learning technique used for grouping data points into distinct clusters based on similarity. The goal of the project is to explore how K-Means identifies natural groupings within a dataset and to visualize the clusters effectively.

# 🎯 Objective

To apply the K-Means clustering algorithm to a dataset and identify patterns or groupings within the data, providing useful insights through visualization and analysis.

# ⚙️ Key Steps

Data Collection & Preprocessing – Load the dataset, clean missing values, and scale the features for better clustering results.

Choosing the Number of Clusters (k) – Use the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters.

Model Training – Apply the K-Means algorithm to group similar data points.

Visualization – Plot the clusters and centroids using Matplotlib or Seaborn for better understanding.

Result Analysis – Interpret cluster characteristics and identify meaningful patterns.
